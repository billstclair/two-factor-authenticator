# Two-Factor Authenticator

`totp.html` is a stand-alone web page contaning JavaScript which generates a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) based on a user-entered secret key.

This directory is live at [billstclair.com/two-factor-authenticator](https://billstclair.com/two-factor-authenticator/). It contains its own documentation.

Distilled from Markus Gutschke's [TOTP Debugger](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/blob/master/libpam/totp.html) and released under the same Apache license. His file is in this repository as `totp-debugger.html`.
